## 1. Introduction

Tuning an FPV drone's flight controller is overwhelming for many pilots, especially beginners. Betaflight exposes powerful tuning controls (PIDs, filters), but optimizing them requires interpreting Blackbox logs. This document specifies an application that guides users end-to-end: connect the drone over USB, perform guided test flights, collect Blackbox logs, analyze them, apply tuning changes, and explain every change in beginner-friendly terms.

Primary focus: filter tuning (noise vs latency) and PID tuning (step response). The app must support configuration versioning (snapshots), comparisons, and rollback. AI is optional in MVP; the tuning engine must be deterministic (rules/metrics) and work offline.

| 2 | Automated PID tuning from Blackbox (P/D balance using step response metrics) | :white_check_mark: Analysis engine + auto-apply to FC via MSP. Convergent, flight-PID-anchored. Master gain step deferred. |
| 3 | Beginner-first UX: wizard flow + clear explanations + safety checks | :white_check_mark: Wizard UI, results display with before/after cards, apply confirmation, interactive charts, flight guides. |
| 4 | Full local workflow: USB connect, log download/import, analysis, apply settings | :white_check_mark: Complete end-to-end: connect → download → parse → analyze → apply → rollback. |
| 5 | Configuration versioning: snapshots, rollback, labeling, export/import | :white_check_mark: Full snapshot system with diff view, restore/rollback, safety backups. |
| 6 | Cross-platform: Windows/macOS/Linux | :white_check_mark: Electron app with cross-platform builds (macOS .dmg, Windows .exe, Linux .AppImage). CI/CD via GitHub Actions. |
| 7 | Minimal cloud dependencies; optional AI via user-supplied API key | :white_check_mark: Fully offline. AI integration deferred. |

- Validate log parsing accuracy against known-good logs from multiple FC types
- Verify recommendation quality (are filter/PID suggestions actually improving flight?)
- UX polish: fix any workflow friction, confusing labels, missing feedback
- Test edge cases: different FC boards, firmware versions, flash sizes
- Re-test log parsing with various Betaflight versions (4.3, 4.4, 4.5)

#### 7b: Real FC E2E :x:
Automated end-to-end tests running in CI pipeline against a real FC connected to a dedicated machine.

**Goals:**
- Dedicated test runner machine with FC physically connected via USB
