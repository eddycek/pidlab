# Pro Version Strategy & 10-Year Financial Plan

> **Status**: Proposed

## Executive Summary

PIDlab uses an **open-core freemium model**: all tuning functionality is free, Pro unlocks multi-drone profiles and diagnostic reports. Revenue comes from two streams: **lifetime licenses ($35-$59)** and **annual subscriptions ($15-$19)**, with an optional **Premium tier ($39/year)** from year 2.

**Key projections:**
- Break-even: Month 1 (costs are negligible)
- 5-year cumulative profit: **$134K**
- 10-year cumulative profit: **$600K**
- Year 10 annual recurring revenue: **$85K**

## 1. Pricing Architecture

### Tier Structure

| Feature | Free | Pro Lifetime | Pro Annual | Premium Annual |
|---------|------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **Price** | $0 | $35→$49→$59 | $15→$19/yr | $39/yr |
| **Available from** | Day 1 | Day 1 | Day 1 | Year 2 |
| Drone profiles | 1 | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Filter Tune | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| PID Tune | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Flash Tune | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Analysis overview | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Tuning history | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Snapshots & restore | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Diagnostic reports | — | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Cloud backup & sync | — | — | — | Yes |
| Preset marketplace | — | — | — | Yes |
| Priority support | — | — | — | Yes |

### Price Escalation Schedule

| Period | Lifetime | Annual Sub | Premium |
|--------|----------|------------|---------|
| Year 1 (launch) | $35 | $15/yr | — |
| Year 2 | $49 | $15/yr | $39/yr |
| Year 3+ | $59 | $19/yr | $39/yr |

**Rationale:** Early adopters get the best deal (reward for risk). Price increases are justified by feature additions and proven value. Lifetime stays expensive enough to push users toward subscriptions.

### Target Ratios

| Period | Lifetime % | Standard Sub % | Premium % |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Year 1 | 40% | 60% | — |
| Year 2 | 35% | 50% | 15% |
| Year 3+ | 30% | 55% | 15% |

## 2. Open Source Strategy

**Decision: Stay public (open-core model).**

### Why Open Source

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Certum Open Source OV** | Requires public repo. Private = $200-400/yr regular OV cert |
| **Hardware trust** | Users need to verify USB/MSP code before connecting $500+ FC |
| **Community** | FPV community values openness; builds word-of-mouth |
| **Discovery** | GitHub stars, search indexing, blog mentions |
| **Contributions** | Bug reports, translations, edge-case testing from community |

### What's Protected

- License keys are Ed25519 signed — can't be generated without private key
- Cloud sync backend is proprietary (CF Workers, not in repo)
- Premium features require server-side validation
- Brand, UX, and update velocity are the real moat

### License Choice

**GPL-3.0-only** — prevents proprietary forks (must share modifications under GPL) while allowing personal use and community contributions. Chosen over BSL 1.1 (too restrictive for community trust) and AGPL-3.0 (unnecessary for desktop app with no network interaction).

## 3. Operating Costs

### Annual Cost Breakdown

| Item | Year 1 | Year 2+ | Notes |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| Cloudflare Workers + R2 + D1 | $85 | $85 | Telemetry, license API, diagnostics |
| Domain (pidlab.app) | $15 | $15 | Google Domains / Cloudflare |
| Apple Developer Program | $99 | $99 | macOS code signing + notarization |
| Certum Open Source OV | $50 | $29 | Windows code signing (renewal cheaper) |
| GitHub (public repo) | $0 | $0 | Free for public repos |
| Stripe fees (~2% avg) | ~$49 | ~$177+ | Blended EU/non-EU rate on revenue |
| Resend (transactional email) | $0 | $0 | Free tier (3K/month) |
| Trivi (invoicing) | $0 | $0 | Existing accounting subscription |
| **Total fixed** | **$249** | **$228** |
| **Total with Stripe fees** | **$298** | **$405+** | Stripe scales with revenue |

### Cost Scaling Model

Stripe is the only cost that scales with revenue. At 2% blended rate:

| Annual Revenue | Stripe Fee | Fixed Costs | Total Costs | Cost % |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| $2,400 | $48 | $249 | $297 | 12.4% |
| $10,000 | $200 | $228 | $428 | 4.3% |
| $50,000 | $1,000 | $228 | $1,228 | 2.5% |
| $100,000 | $2,000 | $228 | $2,228 | 2.2% |

**Insight:** Margins improve dramatically with scale. At $50K+ revenue, costs are <3%.

## 4. Market Sizing

### FPV Drone Market (TAM → SAM → SOM)

| Level | Size | Basis |
|-------|------|-------|
| **TAM** (Total Addressable) | ~500K | Active Betaflight users worldwide (GitHub downloads, configurator telemetry) |
| **SAM** (Serviceable Available) | ~150K | BF 4.3+ users who tune PIDs (not just flash-and-fly) |
| **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable) | ~25K | Realistic 5-year download base with organic + influencer marketing |

### User Acquisition Assumptions

| Year | New Downloads | Basis |
|------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | 3,000 | Reddit, RCGroups, word-of-mouth |
| 2 | 7,500 | First influencer reviews, GitHub trending |
| 3 | 15,000 | Established reputation, multiple reviews |
| 4 | 20,000 | Community standard tool |
| 5-10 | 25,000/yr | Mature market, steady state |

### Conversion Assumptions

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 | Year 10 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Free→Paid conversion | 3.0% | 4.0% | 5.0% | 6.0% |
| Subscription retention | 75% | 75% | 75% | 75% |
| Premium retention | 80% | 80% | 80% | 80% |
| Active user retention | 60% | 60% | 60% | 60% |

**Conversion rationale:** Desktop developer tools typically see 2-5% conversion. PIDlab targets a passionate niche (FPV pilots spend $1000+ on gear), so 3-6% is conservative.

### Revenue Composition Over Time

| Year | Lifetime % | Recurring % | Recurring ARR |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | 61% | 39% | $810 |
| 3 | 44% | 56% | $13,459 |
| 5 | 36% | 64% | $39,589 |
| 7 | 28% | 72% | $62,986 |
| 10 | 24% | 76% | $85,151 |

**Key insight:** By year 5, recurring revenue dominates. By year 10, the business generates **$85K ARR** from subscriptions alone — this continues even with zero new customers.

## 6. User Base Composition

| Year | Active Free | Active Paid | Paid % | Lifetime | Std Sub | Premium |
|------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | 3,000 | 90 | 2.9% | 36 | 54 | 0 |
| 3 | 12,300 | 889 | 6.7% | 308 | 460 | 121 |

## 8. Key Performance Indicators

### Monthly Dashboard Metrics

| KPI | Target Y1 | Target Y3 | Target Y5 |
|-----|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Monthly downloads | 250 | 1,250 | 2,083 |
| Free→Paid conversion | 3.0% | 4.0% | 5.0% |
| Subscription retention (annual) | 75% | 75% | 75% |

| Conversion > 6% | Raise prices sooner |
| Lifetime:Sub ratio > 50:50 | Increase lifetime price or remove lifetime option |
| Subscription churn > 35% | Add retention features (cloud sync, annual discount) |
| >500 GitHub stars | Time for ProductHunt launch |
| Influencer review published | Run time-limited discount campaign |

## 9. Risk Analysis

### Downside Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| BF adds built-in PID analysis | Medium (3yr) | -30-50% TAM | Differentiate on UX, multi-drone workflow, history |
| EU drone regulation kills hobby FPV | Low | -50% market | Expand to commercial drone tuning |
| No influencer pickup in Y1 | Medium | -50% Y1 revenue | Direct community engagement, YouTube content |
| Open source fork competitor | Very Low | -10% | Brand, update speed, cloud features are moat |
| Stripe account suspension | Very Low | Temporary 0 revenue | Keep LemonSqueezy as backup processor |

### Upside Opportunities

| Opportunity | Probability | Impact | Action Trigger |
|-------------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Joshua Bardwell review | Medium | 3-5x spike (months) | Active outreach in Phase 2 |
| ProductHunt launch | High (self-driven) | 2-3x spike (weeks) | After >500 GitHub stars |
| Corporate/team license | Low-Medium | +$20K/yr | When >3 inquiries from same org |
| BF official partnership | Low | Massive credibility | After >5K active users |
| Mobile companion app | Medium | New revenue stream | Year 3+, if Premium successful |

## 10. Scenario Analysis (10-Year Cumulative)

| Scenario | Assumptions | 10-Year Profit |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Bear case** | 50% of projected users, 2% conversion, no Premium | $148K |
| **Base case** | As modeled | $600K |
| **Bull case** | 150% users, 7% conversion, corporate tier | $1.2M |
| **Disaster** | BF adds analysis in Y2, 70% user loss | $45K |

Even the disaster scenario covers costs and provides meaningful side income.

## 11. Tax & Legal Considerations

### Czech Republic (OSVČ/s.r.o.)

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Business form** | OSVČ (sole trader) initially, s.r.o. when revenue > 2M CZK/yr (~$85K) |
| **Income tax (OSVČ)** | 15% flat rate, 60% expense lump sum for software |
| **VAT registration** | Mandatory at 2M CZK/yr turnover (~$85K), voluntary earlier |
| **VAT rate** | 21% on EU B2C sales |
| **OSS registration** | Required when EU cross-border B2C > €10K |
| **Stripe payouts** | SEPA to Czech bank account, weekly |
| **Accounting** | Trivi (automated) + annual tax return |

### Effective Tax Rate Estimate

| Annual Revenue | OSVČ Tax (15% on 40%) | Effective Rate |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| $10,000 | $600 | 6% |
| $50,000 | $3,000 | 6% |
| $85,000+ (switch to s.r.o.) | Varies | 15-19% |

**Note:** With 60% lump sum deduction (software category), effective OSVČ tax rate is ~6%. This is one of the most tax-efficient setups in the EU.

## 12. Summary & Recommendation

### The Numbers

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 5 | Year 10 |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Active free users | 3,000 | 22,500 | 30,000 |
| Active paid users | 90 | 2,644 | 6,681 |
| Annual revenue | $2,070 | $61,714 | $111,701 |
| Annual profit | $1,780 | $60,252 | $109,239 |
| Cumulative profit | $1,780 | $133,516 | $599,716 |
| MRR | $68 | $3,299 | $7,096 |

### Strategic Priorities (Ranked)

1. **Distribution > Features** — One good YouTube review = 6 months of coding. Invest in outreach.
2. **Recurring > Lifetime** — Push subscriptions via pricing. Lifetime is the "expensive comfort option."
3. **Stay open source** — Trust, community, Certum cert savings, and discovery outweigh piracy risk.
4. **Premium tier in Year 2** — Cloud sync is expected by users, pure recurring, and creates switching cost.
5. **Price escalation is free money** — Zero effort, significant impact. Do it on schedule.
6. **Keep costs near zero** — Cloudflare free tiers are the foundation. Don't add AWS/GCP.
