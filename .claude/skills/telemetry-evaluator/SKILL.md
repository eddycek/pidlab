# Telemetry Evaluator

You evaluate PIDlab's telemetry data to determine whether the application is meeting its
goals: improving users' flight performance through automated PID and filter tuning.

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for **environment** and **mode**. Arguments can appear in any order.

- **Environment**: `dev` or `prod` — defaults to **`prod`**
- **Mode**: `evaluate`, `rules`, `convergence`, `compare`, `events` — defaults to **`evaluate`**

Examples:
- `/telemetry-evaluator` → prod + evaluate
- `/telemetry-evaluator dev` → dev + evaluate
- `/telemetry-evaluator rules` → prod + rules
- `/telemetry-evaluator dev rules` → dev + rules
- `/telemetry-evaluator convergence prod` → prod + convergence
- `/telemetry-evaluator events <installationId>` → prod + events for installation
- `/telemetry-evaluator dev events <installationId> <sessionId>` → dev + events filtered by session

## Data Access

All data comes from the telemetry admin API. You MUST set `PIDLAB_ENV` before sourcing `_env.sh`
because it prompts interactively (which Claude Code cannot answer).

```bash
# Set environment BEFORE sourcing (avoids interactive prompt)
export PIDLAB_ENV=prod   # or "dev" — determined from $ARGUMENTS above
source infrastructure/scripts/_env.sh
```

Then use curl to fetch data:
```bash
curl -sf -H "X-Admin-Key: $PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_ADMIN_KEY" \
  "$PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_API_URL/admin/stats/<endpoint>" | jq .
```

Available endpoints:
- `/admin/stats` — overview (installs, active users, mode distribution)
- `/admin/stats/rules` — rule fire/apply counts, avg delta, avg improvement
- `/admin/stats/metrics` — noise floor, overshoot, bandwidth, phase margin distributions
- `/admin/stats/verification` — verification success rates by mode
- `/admin/stats/convergence` — quality score trends across sessions
- `/admin/stats/quality` — quality score histogram
- `/admin/stats/sessions` — session counts by mode
- `/admin/stats/full` — everything in one call
- `/admin/stats/errors` — aggregated error stats, funnel dropoff (v3)
- `/admin/events?id=<uuid>` — events for specific installation (v3, optional &session=, &type=)

## Modes

Determine the mode from parsed `$ARGUMENTS` (see above):

### Mode: `evaluate` (default)

Full KPI evaluation report.

1. Fetch all data (use environment parsed from arguments):
   ```bash
   export PIDLAB_ENV=<env>   # "prod" or "dev" from argument parsing
   source infrastructure/scripts/_env.sh
   curl -sf -H "X-Admin-Key: $PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_ADMIN_KEY" "$PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_API_URL/admin/stats/full" | jq . > /tmp/telemetry-full.json
   curl -sf -H "X-Admin-Key: $PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_ADMIN_KEY" "$PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_API_URL/admin/stats/rules" | jq . > /tmp/telemetry-rules.json
   curl -sf -H "X-Admin-Key: $PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_ADMIN_KEY" "$PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_API_URL/admin/stats/verification" | jq . > /tmp/telemetry-verification.json
   curl -sf -H "X-Admin-Key: $PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_ADMIN_KEY" "$PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_API_URL/admin/stats/convergence" | jq . > /tmp/telemetry-convergence.json
   curl -sf -H "X-Admin-Key: $PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_ADMIN_KEY" "$PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_API_URL/admin/stats/metrics" | jq . > /tmp/telemetry-metrics.json
   curl -sf -H "X-Admin-Key: $PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_ADMIN_KEY" "$PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_API_URL/admin/stats/errors" | jq . > /tmp/telemetry-errors.json
   ```

2. Read all fetched files and evaluate against KPIs (see below)

3. Generate report in this format:

```markdown

```

### Mode: `rules`

Deep dive into rule effectiveness.

1. Fetch rules data: `/admin/stats/rules`
2. For each rule, analyze:
   - Fire rate (how often it triggers)
   - Apply rate (how often users accept it)
   - Average delta (magnitude of changes)
   - Average improvement when verified
3. Identify:
   - Rules with low apply rate (users don't trust them)
   - Rules with negative improvement (making things worse)
   - Rules that never fire (dead code?)
4. Cross-reference with code: read `src/main/analysis/FilterRecommender.ts`, `PIDRecommender.ts`
5. Suggest threshold adjustments or rule modifications

### Mode: `convergence`

Track quality improvement over time.

1. Fetch convergence data: `/admin/stats/convergence`
2. Analyze:
   - Do users improve across sessions?
   - Which session number sees the biggest jump?
   - What percentage of users are converging?
3. Compare against target: 73% convergence rate
4. If below target, analyze why (data quality? rule effectiveness? user behavior?)

### Mode: `events`

Drill-down into events for a specific installation.

Parse additional arguments after mode: `<installationId>` (required) and optional `<sessionId>`.

1. Fetch events:
   ```bash
   export PIDLAB_ENV=<env>
   source infrastructure/scripts/_env.sh
   URL="$PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_API_URL/admin/events?id=<installationId>"
   # If sessionId provided: URL="$URL&session=<sessionId>"
   curl -sf -H "X-Admin-Key: $PIDLAB_TELEMETRY_ADMIN_KEY" "$URL" | jq . > /tmp/telemetry-events.json
   ```
2. Analyze event timeline:
   - Group by sessionId for session-level view
   - Identify error patterns (repeated errors, error→abandon sequences)
   - Show workflow progression per session
3. Generate timeline report showing event flow with annotations

### Mode: `compare`

Compare metrics across segments.

1. Fetch full data: `/admin/stats/full`
2. Break down by available dimensions:
   - By mode (filter vs pid vs quick)
   - By drone size (if available)
   - By BF version (if available)
3. Identify outliers and patterns:
   - Which mode has best improvement rate?
   - Which drone sizes are under-served?
   - Do certain BF versions correlate with issues?

## Target KPIs

| KPI | Target | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Recommendation apply rate | >70% | Users trust our recommendations |
| Verification improvement rate | >60% | Verification flights show improvement |
| Mean noise floor improvement | -2 dB+ | Filter Tune reduces noise |
| Mean overshoot reduction | -5%+ | PID Tune reduces overshoot |
| Quality score convergence | Session N+1 > N | Users improve over time |
| Rule positive delta rate | >50% per rule | Each rule helps more than it hurts |
| Data quality distribution | >50% good+ | Users fly quality data flights |

## Scoring

Calculate overall score (0-100):
- Each KPI contributes equally (100/7 = ~14.3 points)
- PASS = full points, PARTIAL (within 80% of target) = half points, FAIL = 0
- Tier: 80-100 Excellent, 60-79 Good, 40-59 Fair, 0-39 Poor

## Important Notes

- If endpoints return errors or empty data, report "Insufficient data" rather than failing
- Always show absolute numbers alongside percentages (context matters)
- When making recommendations, reference specific rule IDs and code locations
- Be honest about limitations — small sample sizes mean noisy metrics
